This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
It fetches data from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

Eventhough the challenge was suppose to be 4 hours, I took about 1 extra hour learning React Context and had some fun styling it.\
The overall logic of the features respected the defined time.

This project used React + Tailwind (css is a bit messy due to time constraints)
